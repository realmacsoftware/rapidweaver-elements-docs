# Resources

Website resources include anything from image files to PDFs and folders. All of your resources can be managed right inside RapidWeaver Elements.

### Adding Resources

Open the resources list in the left-hand sidebar, and drag and drop in files (and folders), from the Finder. The structure and naming of your files will be the same in-app and when it's exported to the finder.

#### Supported File Types&#x20;

Elements supports adding all files types (including Folders) to the resources browser. However, some file types have extra support.

* Images - png, svg, jpg, etc…
* YouTube URL - Single video's and playlists
* Vimeo URL - Single video's and playlists

### Editing Metadata

Right-click on a file and select "show Info" to edit the meta data. The file inspector is a floating window and can be left open while you browse through files in the Resources area.

* Filename (All file types)
* Caption (images)
* Author (images)
