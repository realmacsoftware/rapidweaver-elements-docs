# Elements FAQ

This document will continue to evolve as we receive new questions or as development changes and we approach the launch.

#### Q: When is the official launch date for Elements?

Our goal is to launch Elements in 2024. However, the exact public launch date will depend on the progress of development and the feedback we receive during the beta phase.

#### Q: What are the system requirements for Elements?

Requires macOS Ventura (13.x) or newer.

#### Q: Will my existing RapidWeaver themes be compatible?

Elements will not support Classic legacy themes. It’s been a tough decision to make, but ultimately we think Elements will be a much better product if we build it for the future.

Elements supports a new style themes that are more modern, and work in a totally different way to Classic themes.

#### Q: Are legacy stacks compatible with Elements?

No, stacks are not compatible and cannot be used in Elements.

#### Q: I have created my own stacks, will I be able to convert them into Elements?

Yes, but converting them is a manual process. We offer support and documentation to help with this.

#### Q: Can I import my RapidWeaver Classic projects into RapidWeaver Elements?

Not at this time, Element based websites are built completely differently so there's no easy way to open those older Classic documents. We may look at building an importer at a later date, should the demand be there.

#### Q: Is it possible to use RapidWeaver Classic and RapidWeaver Elements side-by-side?

Yes, you can install and run both applications simultaneously on your Mac. We anticipate this scenario to be quite popular. It allows users to manage older projects in Classic while simultaneously migrating and developing newer projects in Elements.

#### Q: Will RapidWeaver Classic be phased out and replaced by RapidWeaver Elements?

No, both versions of RapidWeaver will coexist as they cater to slightly different customer needs.

RapidWeaver Classic continues to serve thousands of customers who maintain and build existing websites using a variety of legacy plugins and addons. We will continue to develop and update RapidWeaver Classic to support this "classic" workflow. RapidWeaver Classic requires macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or a newer version.

RapidWeaver Elements represents our vision for reimagining web design on the Mac. Our goal is to make it easier and more powerful than ever before. RapidWeaver Elements leverages the latest Apple technologies and requires macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or newer.

#### Q: Do you plan to bring Elements to iPad?

While the initial version of Elements will not run on iPad, the technology we've built does open up the possibilities of making this a reality (something that just wasn't possible with Classic). It's important to note that this is not currently in our near future plans, as our primary focus is on the Mac platform at this time.

#### Q: I’m interested in developing third-party Elements, do you have any documentation?
