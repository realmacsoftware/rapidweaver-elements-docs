# How To

Converting your stacks to Elements is easy. Simply follow these steps to get started.

1. Open RapidWeaver Elements
2. Open the app Settings (command + ,)
3. Navigate to the Developer tab
4. Click the plus button and choose "Convert Stacks to Elements…"
5. Choose single or multiple stacks that you'd like to convert from the open panel.

This will open the stack converter window and RapidWeaver will begin the conversion process.

To see your converted stacks, just use the "Reveal Addons Folder…" option in the RapidWeaver menu. The .elementpack file will be placed in the following location:

```
Addons > Elements > your-awesome.elementpack
```

## stacks Converter

The stacks conveter is far more than just a conversion tool, stacks developers have previously had no way to validate their templates and other content. In Elements we decided to tackle this head on and create a tool that can find and report problems in stacks and is recommended for all stack developers.
