# Resources

Website resources include anything from image files to PDFs and folders. All of your resources can be managed right inside RapidWeaver Elements.

### Adding Resources

Open the resources list in the left-hand sidebar, and drag and drop in files (and folders), from the Finder. The structure and naming of your files will be the same in-app and when it's exported to the finder.

Elements supports adding all files types (including Folders) to the resources browser. However, some file types have extra support.
