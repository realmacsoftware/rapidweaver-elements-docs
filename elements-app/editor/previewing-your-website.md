# Previewing Your Website

Elements has a built in webserver that supports PHP 8. While the WYSIWYG editor allows you to view your design, you'll sometimes want to check how it looks in a browser.

To preview your website in your default browser, you can click the Safari Browser icon in the toolbar (Command-P). You can also press Command-Option-P to choose a different browser.
