# SVG



### Q\&A on fixing SVG's for display on a website.

Getting SVG's to display correctly is a bit of a dark art, but with a bit of tinkering you'll be able to modify them to work and look great on the web and in Elements.

#### Q: Why doesn't the SVG doesn't change size when I adjust the sizing in Elements?

A: Remove the height and width values in the SVG file, see screenshot below for an example.
