# Common Controls

While each component has a set of unique controls, we've designed them so many of the components also share a set of common controls.

Common controls in Elements make it easier to create visually consistent, user-friendly websites, speeding up the design process and simplifying both learning and customization for users at all skill levels.

For beginners or users new to Elements, shared or common controls reduce the learning curve significantly. Instead of needing to master a different set of controls for each component, they can focus on understanding a core set of common settings that apply across the board.

By learning these shared controls, you only need to understand how to use a specific set of controls once, which can then be applied across various components. With common controls across multiple components, making changes becomes faster. You'll be able  adjust the same properties (like padding, margin, colors, effects, or typography) across different components without having to search for or relearn where those settings are.
