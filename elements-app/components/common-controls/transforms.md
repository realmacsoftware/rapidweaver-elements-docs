# Transforms

Transforms in Elements allow you to manipulate the position, size, and orientation of components all without writing a line of code. Transforms are a powerful way to apply effects like rotating, scaling, translating (moving), and skewing elements, making it easy to add dynamic and interactive visual effects to your design.

You can also use transforms to create hover or focus effects that make elements feel more interactive and responsive.
