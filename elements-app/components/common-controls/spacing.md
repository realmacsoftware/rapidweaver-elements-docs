# Spacing

The Spacing controls allow you to add Margin and Padding to an object. By default this control is disabled.

The "Mask & Paintbrush" icon will toggle the control between selecting from a Theme Preset and setting an arbitrary value. To change the arbitrary value, click and drag the mouse up and down. To change it by increments of 5px hold down the `command` key while dragging.

To link the opposite value, click the dashed line so the highlight is set to blue. This can be done indipendantly for vertical and horizotal values.

### Margin

The Margin property controls the space around an element, outside of its border. It creates space between the element and its neighboring elements.

Margins can be set for all four sides of an element—top, right, bottom, and left—or individually for each side.

### Padding

The Padding property controls the space inside an element, between its content and the element’s border. Unlike margin, which affects the space outside an element, padding pushes the content inward, creating internal spacing within the element itself.

Padding can be set for all four sides of an element—top, right, bottom, and left—or individually for each side.
