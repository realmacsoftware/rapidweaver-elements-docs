# Responsive Breakpoints

The responsive breakpoint system in Elements allows you to change component properties at different user defined breakpoints (i.e. Mobile, Table, Desktop, etc).

Breakpoints for a project be defined in the [Screens](theme-studio/screens.md) area of the [Theme Studio](theme-studio/).
