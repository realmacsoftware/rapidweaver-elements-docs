# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
The Elements language is still in development, features and documentation will be updated as development progresses.
{% endhint %}

The Elements language is a simple, yet powerful **templating language** for RapidWeaver Elements.

The Elements language allows third-party developers to create custom Elements that can be used within the RapidWeaver Elements layout engine. Elements (.rwelementpack) are a bundle of files, usually a mixture of HTML, JS, CSS, JSON, and images.

The only thing you need to start building your own custom Elements is a copy of RapidWeaver and a text editor. Previous web development experience is recommend, but not required.

### What's Required?

The following is a list of suggested tools to make developing Elements easier.

* A licensed copy RapidWeaver Elements Pro

* Icon App to comple an ICN's, we recommend [Icon Slate](https://www.kodlian.com/apps/icon-slate).
* [SF Symbol app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) for icon name reference.
