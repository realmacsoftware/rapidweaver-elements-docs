### Be part of the Independent Web

Realmac Software has always been an indie company and has never taken on outside investment. We've remained an independent and private company for over 20 years. We are and always have been 100% customer funded and focused.

Just like our company, we believe the web should stay open and independent. When you post something on the web, it should [belong to you](https://indieweb.org/own\_your\_data), not a corporation. By joining the [indie web movement](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb), your content stays yours and in your control.

You can post anything you want, in any format you want. In addition, you share simple readable links such as _example.com/ideas_. These links are [permanent](https://indieweb.org/permalinks) and will always work.

Take back control and build your next website with RapidWeaver Elements!
